This script has not been tested on Mac OS. Possible issues include:
- File import - There may be issues with the function to import the XML file. On Windows, the "Open File" dialog filters for files with the extension "fioxml". On Mac OS the filetype filtering is handled differently, and has not been implemented in this version. I don't know if it will prevent Mac users from opening the XML file.
- Comment text formatting - the script attempts to remove unneded line breaks from comments in order to manage their length. UNIX-based text files use different line break characters than Windows does by default, but I don't know if this will be an issue in the XML generated by Frame.io.
- The script currently assumes the presence of annotations. It might throw an error if there are no annotations.

THese issues are currently being investigated, and they will be addressed in the next version.
